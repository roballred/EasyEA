EasyEA – Framework Creating Principles (v1.3)

1. Business First
All architecture decisions must begin with business goals, priorities, and desired outcomes.
Technology serves the business—never the reverse.

2. Value at Every Step
EasyEA must help teams identify value, deliver value, and measure value.
If something does not create meaningful business or customer value, it does not belong in the framework.

3. People-Centered by Design
The framework must start with understanding people—their needs, pain points, tasks, and experiences.
Architecture improves how customers, employees, and partners interact with services, processes, and systems.

4. AI-Enabled from the Beginning
AI must be integrated into how EasyEA is designed and used.
AI should accelerate insight, reduce manual effort, and enhance decision-making across all architecture activities.

5. Rooted in Real Organizational Challenges
Every method, artifact, and recommendation must address real issues organizations face—alignment gaps, legacy complexity, siloed teams, customer experience problems, and delivery friction.
No academic models or theoretical constructs.

6. Simplicity Over Completeness
EasyEA prioritizes clarity, usability, and speed.
Anything that cannot be explained quickly or used easily must be simplified or removed.

7. Lightweight and Built for Everyday Work
The framework must fit naturally into business, product, and delivery workflows.
Minimal artifacts. Lean governance. Just enough structure to support good decisions.

8. Collaborative by Default
Architecture must be created with business, product, and technology teams.
The framework supports shared understanding, joint decision-making, and co-creation.

9. Designed to Evolve
EasyEA is a continuous, learning-focused framework.
It supports experimentation, feedback loops, incremental improvement, and adaptation as conditions change.
