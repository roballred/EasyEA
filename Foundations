EasyEA Foundations

1. Set the Direction
   Clarify the business goals, the problems we need to solve, and the principles that will guide decisions. Include the outside factors that shape the work, such as regulations, market pressures, or technology limits, so everyone begins with the same purpose and understanding.

2. Understand the People
   Learn what customers, employees, and partners need, where they struggle, and what matters most to them. This keeps the work grounded in real human needs instead of assumptions.

3. See How Work Really Happens
   Create a clear view of how the business gets things done today. Look at where steps break down, where delays occur, and where tools or information get in the way. Include a simple look at how information moves, where trust or privacy matter, and where data issues create friction.

4. Find the Best Opportunities
   Identify the improvements that would create the most value for the business and for the people who rely on it. Consider the organization’s capacity for change and the risks that might affect what can realistically be done now.

5. Choose the Way Forward
   Compare a small set of options, consider the trade-offs and risks, and select the approach that best fits goals and constraints. This is where architectural thinking becomes visible by choosing solutions that work not only for one team but for the organization as a whole.

6. Coordinate the Work
   Turn the decision into clear steps, responsibilities, funding alignment, and check-ins that keep everyone moving together. Confirm who owns which decisions, how escalations will be handled, and how teams will stay aligned without adding unnecessary complexity.

7. Track Results and Adjust
   Monitor progress, look at what is working or not working, and adjust direction based on real outcomes. Capture what the organization learns along the way and update skills, practices, and ways of working so the organization becomes stronger over time.
