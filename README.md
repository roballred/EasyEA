# **EasyEA — A Lightweight, Human-Centered, AI-Enabled Enterprise Architecture Framework**

EasyEA is a practical, business-first approach to Enterprise Architecture.
It exists for one purpose: **help organizations make better decisions, faster, with less overhead.**

Unlike traditional EA frameworks, EasyEA is:

* **Simple** (no jargon, no heavy artifacts)
* **Business-aligned** (goals → value → measurable outcomes)
* **Human-centered** (start with real people and their real needs)
* **AI-enabled** (integrates AI into every step)
* **Built for real organizations**,more practical and less theoretical

This repository contains the evolving, minimum viable version of the EasyEA framework—co-created with teams, tested through real work, and designed to evolve.

## **What EasyEA Is**

EasyEA is a **lightweight enterprise architecture operating system** made for:

* Public agencies
* Mid-size enterprises
* Product and transformation teams
* People who need clarit to deliver value quickly

EasyEA focuses on **decision-making**.
It helps teams answer three essential questions:

1. **What are we trying to achieve?**
2. **What is worth doing now?**
3. **How do we move forward together?**

---

## Core Principles

EasyEA is built on nine simple principles that guide every method and artifact.
These are the DNA of the framework.

### **Summarized Principles**

1. **Business First**
   All architecture work must serve clear business goals and outcomes.

2. **Value at Every Step**
   If it doesn’t create business or customer value, it doesn’t belong.

3. **People-Centered**
   Start with understanding real needs, pain points, and tasks.

4. **AI-Enabled**
   Use AI to accelerate insight, reduce effort, and improve decisions.

5. **Solve Real Problems**
   Address genuine organizational challenges—not theory.

6. **Simplicity Over Completeness**
   Prefer clarity and ease-of-use over detail and complexity.

7. **Lightweight & Everyday**
   Fit naturally into daily work with minimal artifacts.

8. **Collaborative by Default**
   Co-create architecture with business, product, and technical teams.

9. **Designed to Evolve**
   Support learning, iteration, and continuous improvement.

## EasyEA Foundations

The foundations describe how EasyEA is applied in real work.
They form a **7-step minimal workflow** any team can use.


### **EasyEA Workflow (7 steps)**

1. **Set the Direction** — Align on goals, problems, and constraints.
2. **Understand the People** — Learn needs, pain points, and desired outcomes.
3. **See How Work Really Happens** — Understand current processes, friction, and data flow.
4. **Find the Best Opportunities** — Identify improvements that create the most value.
5. **Choose the Way Forward** — Compare options and make confident decisions.
6. **Coordinate the Work** — Define clear steps, ownership, funding, and alignment.
7. **Track and Adjust** — Measure outcomes, learn, and improve continuously.

## AI as a Co-Architect ([powered by **EasyARB**](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-680a4cbb55c08191a1ff06dc11e3f963-easyarb))

AI is built into EasyEA from the start. The framework includes **EasyARB**, a purpose-built GPT that accelerates insight, simplifies work, and strengthens decision quality.

AI in EasyEA supports teams by:

* **Accelerating analysis** (personas, workflows, pain points, options)
* **Reducing manual work** (summaries, synthesis, templates)
* **Improving decisions through structured critique**

### AI Critique Patterns

EasyEA uses short, lightweight critique prompts to surface blind spots and avoid groupthink:

* **Missing Pieces Check** — What risks, dependencies, or stakeholders are we overlooking?
* **Opposing View** — What would a skeptic or frontline staff challenge about this?
* **Value Challenge** — Does this meaningfully support the business goals?
* **Simplicity Challenge** — What can be removed or simplified with no loss of value?
* **Stress Test** — How does this option hold up under budget cuts, demand spikes, or staff turnover?

These critiques help teams make clearer, faster, and more confident decisions.

### The Role of EasyARB

**EasyARB** is the AI co-architect for this framework.

AI isn’t an add-on—it’s a **core part of how EasyEA works**.
